== Disruptions

=== The need for Transformation (VUCA world)

|====
|Complexity

Multiple key decision factors

Characteristics:: The situation has many interconnected parts and variables. 
Some information is available or can be predicted, but the volume or nature of it can be overwhelming to process.

Example:: You are doing business in many countries, all with unique regulatory environments, tariffs and cultural values.

Approach:: Restructure, bring on or develop specialists and build up resources adequate to address the complexity.


|Volatility

Rate of change

Characteristics:: The challenge is unexpected or unstable and may be of unknow duration, but it's not necessarily hard to understand; knowledge about it is often available.

Example:: Prices fluctuate after a natural disaster takes a supplier off-line.

Approach:: Build in slack and devote resources to preparedness - for instance, stockpile inventory or overbuy talent. 
These steps are typically expensive; your investment should match the risk.
|Ambiguity

Lack of clarity about meaning of an event

Characteristics:: Casual relationships are completely unclear. 
No precedents exist; you face "unknow unknowns."

Example:: You decide to move into immature or emerging markets or to launch products outside your core competencies.

Approach:: Experiment. 
Understanding cause and effect requires generating hypotheses and testing them. 
Design your experiments so that lessons learned can be broadly applied.
|Uncertainty

Unclear about the present

Characteristics:: Despite a lack of other information, the event's basic cause and effect are known. 
Change is possible but not a given.

Example:: A competitor's pending product launch muddies the future of the business and the market.

Approach:: Invest in information - collect, interpret and share it. 
This works best in conjunction with structural changes, such as adding information analysis networks, that can reduce ongoing uncertainty.

===== The EFQM Model

* Organisation

** Direction
*** Purpose, Vision & Strategy
*** Organisational Culture & Leadership
** Execution
** Results

====== The Fundamentals

The EFQM model structure is based on the simple but powerful logic of asking 3 questions:
.Why (Direction)
+
`Why` does this organistaion exist? 
What purpose does it fulfil? 
Why this particular Strategy...
.How (Execution)
+
`How` does it intend to deliver on its purpose and its strategy...
.What (Results)
+
`What` has it actually achieved to date? 
`What` does it intend to achieve tomorrow...

======= Direction (Positioning statement)

For an organistaion to achieve and sustain outstanding results that meet or exceed the expectations of its stakeholders it is necessary, but not sufficient, for it to:

* Define an inspiring Purpose
* Create a Vision that is aspirational
* Develop a strategy that is centered on creating sustainable value
* Build a winning culture

. Criterion 1:
+
*1.1 Define Purpose & Vision*
+
* Understand: Importance & relevance
* Define: Inspiring purpose - appealing to stakeholders
* Use: Purpose for creating a aspirational vision
* Involve: Stakeholders - connect & involvement
* Identify: Areas for sustainable & outstanding results

*1.2 Identify and Understand stakeholder needs*
+
* Identify stakeholders and prioritize key stakeholders - Help / Hinder
* Understands how its Purpose & Vision affects it key stakeholders
* Identify: Key stakeholders needs & expectations based on its purpose & vision
* Analyses factors influencing behavior, relationship and decision making of key stakeholder and the impact on it.
* Studies and understands key stakeholder competence and impact on its PVS & Business model

Identify your key stakeholders and prioritize. 

Give a weightage on 0-100% scale.

Multiple stakeholders can have same weightage score.

** 150 points (75%) to customer perceptions
** 50 points (25%) to people perceptions
** 0 points for the other 3, recognised stakeholder groups
- A minimum and maximum weighting factor for the 5 recognised stakeholder groups will be introduced as follows:
** None of the 5 recognised stakeholder groups can be scored below 10% of the maximum number of points available
** None of the 5 recognised stakeholder groups can be scored above 40% of the maximum

==== RADAR Guidelines for Direction & Execution
[%header, cols="1, 2, 10"]
|====
|APPROACH
|Guidance
|The applicant needs to achieve:

|Sound
|THe approach has a clear rationale, aims to fulfil and respond to key S/H needs, is described appropriately and is designed to be fit for the future
a|* There is a clear reason to support the choice of the approach in place - what was the rationale behind choosing and/or adopting a specific approach, for instance, by means of research, learning or benchmarking?
* The approach is appropriately described for those needing to understand it e.g. is it visualised, did the 'ways of working' change over time?
* The approach is focused on the key S/H expectations and everyone involved in the execution of it (bot Strategic and Operational e.g. those who benefit from it and also those who use the approach.)
* The approach already shows signs of maturity or is a proven practice, e.g. because the changes made became smaller over time, or the approach has been shown to work also in abnormal or difficult circumstances.
* The approach is designed to be fit for the future and can be adapted to changing circumstances.

|Aligned
|The approach supports an organisation's direction and is integrated with other relevant approaches.
a|* The approach is designed to deliver the desired results (now and in the future), and it is aligned with the organisation's direction.
* There is a visible/logical link with the strategy, and the approach supports one or more strategic objectives.
* The people choosing the approach are aligning it with one or more facets of the strategy, while also considering dependencies from and/or impact on other approaches.
3+|DEPLOYMENT
|Implemented
|The approach is deployed in relevant areas in an effective and timely manner.
a|* The extent to which the approach has been used and is put into practice. 
This may relate to different levels within an organisation's hierarchy; different locations; the number of actual implementations based on the approach; the number of employees actively involved or the various products, services and solutions being offered.
* There is an awareness of the further potential for deployment in-depth and/or breadth.
* Some facts & figures exist to show how often the approach is used, how the use has varied over time and why.
|Flexible
|The execution enables flexibility and adaptation.
a|* There is a plan and timing for the actual deployment that allows flexibility and adaptation according to changing circumstances.
* Example(s) exist where the circumstances required temporary or definitive evolutions, small or big.
3+|ASSESSMENT & REFINEMENT
|Evaluated & Understood
|Feedback on the effectiveness & efficiency of the approach and its deployment is collected, understood and shared.
a|* There is a view for the specific approach on the effectiveness (achieving the desired output) and efficiency (cost in resources/time/money).
* There is a way to know how frequently measuring and collecting feedback should be done e.g. what is a good fit.
* Feedback is analysed, understood and shared with relevant S/Hs in and outside the organisation.
|Learn & Improve
|Findings from emerging trends analysis, measurement, learning and benchmarking are used to inspire creativity and generate innovative solutions to improve performance in appropriate timescales.
a|* Actions to understand future emerging trends and their potential impact are taken.
* There is knowledge resulting from learning activities and comparisons to understand if the approach can be considered as 'outdated', 'normal', 'better' or 'outstanding'.
* There is an awareness of the potential for further improvement (incremental or radical breakthrough e.g. continuous improvement/change/transformation).
* The measurement and learning from above lead to real improvements and are visible in the results.
* There is a way to select and only act on the best ideas and proposals, not on all of them, e.g. based on the understanding of the limitations in time, resource and capabilities when translating ideas to practice.

|====
|RELEVANCE & USABILITY
|Guidance
|The applicant needs to achieve:

|Scope & Relevance
|A set of results that clearly link to the Purpose, Vision & Strategy of the organisation are identified. 
The selected set of results is reviewed and improved over time.
a|* The oganisation is clear about what it needs to measure/achieve/manage to deploy its strategy and understand its impact on key S/H perceptions and Strategic/Operational performance (understand how the selection and prioritisation of results is decided upon).
* The prioritised measures/results used are meaningful within the context of the Direction and Strategy.
* When using the results to understand 'the footprint', impact and performance of the organisation, what is the way to make a difference between the essential, not so essential and non-important results to look at?
* What kind of understandable and useful insights exist on how the various results are related to each other?
* If both the effectiveness and efficiency aspects exist, is there awareness of how these correlate/inter-relate?
* How is the set of results reviewed and adapted when Strategic/Operational changes occur?
|Useable Data
|Results are timely, reliable, accurate and appropriately segmented to provide meaningful insights that support performance improvement and transformation.
a|* The speed, consistency, completeness or any other quality aspects of the data and information used as source are appropriate for the organisation.
* Data, including predictive measures, is gathered and turned into information and insights to aid decision making and drive performance improvement and transformation.
* What is the reason for a specific segmentation when analysing performance/achievements?

3+|PERFORMANCE
|Trends
|Positive trends or sustained outstanding performance over the strategic period/cycle.
a|* What is the clock speed of the sector/operating environment the organisation is active in?
* What the trend evolution over time demonstrates - is the performance improving, stablising or degrading in line with the strategic objectives and operational targets?
* A specific trend is stronger, comparable or weaker than other relevant trends in the sector - how steep or fast?

|Targets
|Relevant targets are set in line with the Strategy and are consistently achieved.
a|* For a selected key result a desired level to be achieved exists, is aligned with the Strategy and is understood by relevant key S/Hs.
* When this desired future performance level for a key result is clear - what is or was the rationale behind agreeing to that specific level?
* How close in reality these desired levels of performance are achieved or surpassed, or not at all, and how this impacts adapting the targets for the future.

|Comparisons
|Relevant external comparisons suitable to position own performance in line with the strategic direction are made and are favourable.
a|* If there is (starting with strategic direction results) an awareness of similar measures used by 'others', within or outside of the sector or organisation.
* To what extent the information to compare with is valid, can be trusted, is easy to use etc. to position their own performance.
* What does the comparison say about a specific measure? 
Is it a bit or much better, may be even 'the best', or just in the same range, or a bit/ a lot worse, and how it impacts target setting?
* Notice: Competitor and industry averages may be used, but for outstanding organisations, these will also show comparisons with best-in-class or world-class - they can show they 'are the benchmark', they perform at a level others would like to be at.
|Future Focus
|Based on current cause & effect relationships, analysis of data sets, performance patterns & predictive measures, the organisation understands the drivers for outstanding performance in the future.
a|* What are the insights gained concerning cause-effect relationships? 
e.g. how the approach has made a significant difference, and which result would never have been achieved without one or more specific actions, projects, initiatives etc.
* For which results is there a high level of trust and strong ability to convince others that the gains achieved in performance will be sustained? 
What is the probability it will further improve or stabilise?
* What are the relevant predictive measures given the sector and operating environment of the organisation?
* How are predictive measures used to understand future performance?
* Comprehension of the KPI linkages and hierarchy e.g., the relationship of upstream and downstream indicators.

==== Scoring Guidelines

Criterion 1,2,4,5: All sub criteria within these criteria are with equal weightage

* Each of the 5 Criterion parts in Purpose, Vision & Strategy contribute 20% of the 100 points allocated to Criterion 1
+
--
a. 1a = 20 points
b. 1b = 20 points
c. 1c = 20 points
d. 1d = 20 points
e. 1e = 20 points
--

* Each of the 4 Criterion parts in Creating Sustainable Value contribute 25% of the 200 points allocated to Criterion 4
+
--
a. 4a = 50 points
b. 4b = 50 points
c. 4c = 50 points
d. 4d = 50 points
--

* In Criterion 7 (Strategic & Operational Performance) there are no criterion parts and so the 200 points available are allocated at the level of criterion 7.

* Criterion 3 & 6
+
The exact value of the weighting factor to be applied to be applied for each of the criterion parts within C3 & C6 will be the decision of the organisation, but it must comply with the minimum and maximum weighting rules for the 5 recognised S/H groups as shown below:
+
- None of the 5 recognised S/H groups can be scored below 10% of the maximum number of points available.
- None of the 5 recognised S/H groups can be scored above 40% of the maximum number of points available.
- Between the lower threshold of 10% and the upper threshold of 40%, organisations can decide on using weighting factors in 5% bandwidths.

==== Suggested Weightages process

*Weighting Factors (see table below)*

* The exact value of the weighting factor to be applied for each of the criterion parts within C3 & C6 will be the decision of the organisation.
* To avoid, for example, an Applicant for the EFQM Global Award (EGA), deciding to allocate the 200 points for S/H perceptions as follows:
** 150 points (75%) to customer perceptions
** 50 points (25%) to people perceptions
** 0 points for the other 3, recognised S/H groups

* A minimum and maximum weighting factor for the 5 recoginsed S/H groups will be introduced as follows:
** None of the 5 recognised S/H groups can be scored below 10% of the maximum number of points available.
** None of the 5 recognised S/H groups can be scored above 40% of the maximum.

The specific participation of the senior leaders in the numerous community activities (e.g. Akshara, Sanjivini, Local Panchayat, and partnerships with First Response a local NGO) is not addressed. 
Thus, the degree to which the senior leaders serve as role models of good citizenship, a core value of the applicant, is not apparent (explicit so what)

===== Presentation & Discussion

====== Results - Relevance & Usability

*Consider the following:*
* Relevance to Strategy, Stakeholder needs/expectations
* Current and future competitive advantage
* Relevant deployment spread based on the business
* Dependability of Measurements particularly for perception measures e.g. sample size, methodology, bias free, S/H expectations
* Explanation about the dips in the performance
* Appropriate range of parameters
* Use of segmented results
* Results presented based on strategic cycles

====== Results - Excellence of Results

*Evaluate the performance on the following attributes:*
* The existence of positive trends and /or sustained good performance over the strategic cycle.
* Whether targets are set and consistently achieved for key results inline with strategic priorities.
* Comparisons with relevant external organisations are made and are favourable for key results inline with strategic goals.
* The future focus on the results based on established cause and effect relationship, data sets and predictive analysis.

*Trends, Targets, Comparisons, Alignment with processes give deeper insight to organisation's performance*

====== Results statement - Elements

* Subject - The applicant or the result(s)
* Timeframe - (in, from/to)
* Numbers - at #, from #
* Linkages to key themes
* Segmentation
* Comparison to what?
* Gaps (Target, Benchmarks)
* So what

====== Results Statement - Example (Strengths)

AC Nielsen Survey results on 20 Thought leaders indicate an increase in ratings of the applicant from 4 to 3 from 2018-2020. 
Also Aon Hewitt best employers survey of 2019 ranks them at 15th place in the top 25 indian cos as a best employer. 
HR practices have also been recognized and awarded by agencies such as Greentech, NHRD, HT power jobs etc.

====== Results Statement - Example (OFI)

While the applicant shows overall customer satisfaction for product quality in the year 2020, trends are not presented to track the rate of improvement (Figure - 6.1-1). 
In addition, the data is not segmented by key customer groups (e.g., industrial, commercial). 
Thus, it is not clear how the applicant identifies variation in its customer satisfaction performance over time from sector to sector, and targets opportunities for improvement.

====== Some Results "So What's"

* No segmentation: It is not evident how the applicant is able to identify improvement opportunities unique to key product or customer segments or how the company can capitalize on relative strengths for intra-company learning.
* No comparison data - It is not apparent how the applicant is fully able to assess the relative strength of its results and set meaningful targets.
* No competitive data - It is not clear how the applicant determines it is gaining or maintaining competitive advantage in this area.
* No data on some KEY requiremetns/processes/etc. - It is not evident how the applicant tracks progress in these areas/manages and improves. (efficiency, effectiveness and reliability measures).
* No targets - It is not clear how the applicant is able to assess the gap in performance with respect to its plan and use it for corrective and learning activities.

====== Variability amongst Assessors

* Scoring is not an exact science
* Variation is to be expected
* An initial 3:1 variation in scoring is not unusual
* Assessor perceptions are different
* Assessor understanding and application of the criteria are different
* Assessor understanding of RADAR are different

===== Group Work

*Assessing Strategic & Operational Performance*

Sub criteria 7

* Read the abstract and the requirements of the EFQM model and identify the Strengths & OFIs
** Individual observation
** Consensus observations

===== Group Work - Guidelines

* Read the document
* Identify the results associated with the assigned category under criterion 7
* Assess the data given and identify the key themes and the RADAR attributes connected to each statement
* Prepare the STs & OFIs for the assigned Result category
* Retain, merge, edit or Part for discussion
* Use the above for scoring

=== Presentation & Discussion

==== How to look out for potential STs & OFIs

* The extent to which the requirements of sub-criterion is addressed (look at verbs, intent of sub-criterion along with the key themes)
* To what extent the RADAR elements and attributes are covered or not addressed or has gaps (A, D, A&R, R&U, P)

=== Scoring Guidelines
* Score direction, execution & results separately
* Least count is in a band of 5
* Consider all STs & OFIs with an overall perspective
* Decide the degree of evidence to arrive at the appropriate band. 
Start from 50.
* Consider each attributes of (S A I F EU LI / S, U, T, T, C, F) individually for scoring the sub criterion once

==== Direction & Execution
* Based on the above compute S/1, I/1, EU+LI/2 - Direction
* Based on the above compute S+A/2, I+F/2, EU+LI/2 - Execution
* These give you the score of A, D, A&R
* Overall score = A+D+A&R/3

Overall score should not exceed the score of the approach and is also limited by the max score for soundness attribute for Direction & Execution.

===== Scoring Guidelines

Results
* Similarly, compute S+U/2 for R&U, (T+T+C+F)/4 for performance
* Overall score: (R&U+p)/2

NOTE: Overall score cannot exceed the score of the Scope & Relevance attribute

==== Exercise

Linking the sub-criterion, RADAR and Quality of statements

==== Hints for efficient team working
. Choose a lead, presenter & time-keeper in your team
. Rotate duties at each round
. Listen to all members
. Document your observations
. Arrive at a consensus

===== Exercise 1: Feedback statements

Steps:
* Identify the statement under Direction / Execution / Result as applicable.
* Identify the sub-criterion from the EFQM Model booklet
* Identify the Element (A/D/A&R)/(R&U/P)
* Classify it as either a ST/OFI
* Discuss on the quality of statements

==== Feedback statements

Statement 1. Faster product introduction and time to market reduction have been identified as strategic challenges as well as one of the important future objectives of unit. 
However, a systematic process of crating a framework of measurements to monitor progress in-line with this objective is not present. 
For example: Results have been reported only for number of new products introduced however time to introduce these products or time to adopt new technology vis a vis competitors is not being tracked.

Statement 2. The organisation has identified OTC as a way of creating breakthrough changes in the operations. 
The strategic think tank reviews the progress of these initiatives and supports this in the area of materials management, maintenance etc. by way of improvement initiatives.

== Feedback Process

=== Feedback Report - Content
* Description of assessment process
* An Executive summary (overview) of the assessment findings - 2 to 4 pages
* For each sub-criterion:
** STs
** OFIs
* Score band (%) for each criterion 0-10%, 11-20% etc.
* Total score is represented in the bands of 25 points each like 400-424 / 550-574 ... and so on.
* Benchmark score band at the criteria level and overall are also indicated to measure relative performance of the applicant. (based on the CII EXIM Award program)

=== Feedback Comments
* Feedback comments must help the applicant in understanding the STs and OFIs vital for its business and review the strategy for improvement.
* Comments must be supported by facts (from application + site visit)
* All OFIs (about 100 for 23 direction & Execution sub-criteria and the 2 result criteria) need not be addressed as independent projects as they have inter-linkages of cause and effect. 
Highlight those key OFIs which will have the larger impact on the organisation at that stage of devlopment maturity.
* The applicant needs to understand the linkages amongst the criterion and its key themes while developing its action plan for improvement.
* Comments must be linked to Key factors & key themes, and not in conflict with others.
