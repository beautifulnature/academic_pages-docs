== properties of multiplicaton of integers
=== closure under multiplication
Integers are closed under multiplication.

a x b is an integer, for all integers a, b.

here closed means product of any two integers is an integer.
=== commutativity of multiplication
=== multiplication by zero
=== multiplicative identity
=== associativity for multiplication
=== distrubutive property
=== making multiplication easier
